# React Router v6 Catch-All Route Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Router v6 where a catch-all route (`/*`) interferes with other, more specific routes, causing unexpected routing behavior.  The problem stems from the order of route definitions within the `Routes` component. The catch-all route, if defined before specific routes, will always match first, regardless of a potential match with other routes. 

## How to Reproduce:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`.
4. Navigate to `/about`. It should show the Not Found component instead of the About component because of incorrect route placement.

## Solution:
The solution involves carefully placing the catch-all route at the end of the `Routes` component.  This ensures that other, more specific, routes are evaluated before the catch-all route handles unmatched paths.
